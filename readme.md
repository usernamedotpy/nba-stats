## NBA Stats
Use a GUI to select stats from NBA stats website to find top players in that
catagory.

Ability to mesh stats together to find the top players in that category.
Stats are webscraped from the website, perform calculations on stats in order
to find top players.

Ask user for player
    Give list of stat categories: Pnts_Per_Game, Rbnds_Per_Game etc.
    Ability to search for user-input category which 
      would just be a list: stat_catagories = ['Pnts_Per_Game', 'etc.']

Not very useful notes.

Use jxmyhighroller video of top 75 using statistics for reference

Create posts on reddit with tables showing the stats (https://www.reddit.com/r/GoNets/comments/qbqeaa/post_game_thread_the_brooklyn_nets_lose_their/)

Find players with similar numbers in a given area e.g. Use Giannis as a base, the find all the
players who share the similar stats in shooting % and makes.

Find teams with highest stats, either average (probs a bit wonky if you average a teams 
shooting %) or individual player stats above x amount games (or with no filter)
